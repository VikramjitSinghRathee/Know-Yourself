# Know Yourself

The smartphone application comprehends and evaluates a user's core values that are influenced by interactions with others. The app collects daily survey data from the user, displays the most relevant core values as a pie chart, and gives statistics for the change of core values to highlight the user's most significant interactions. Consequently, this application is valuable for the establishment of self-improvement efforts since it facilitates an understanding of a person's essential values.
